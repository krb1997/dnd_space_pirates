# Scene three (Deep space)

**DIALOG:** As the engines spin down and the ship falls to cruising speeds. The
consoles detect no fleet... or anyone... Suddenly a massive explosion is felt
throughout the ship plunging it into darkness. Alarms from every panel and
console start going haywire and emergency lighting flickers and comes online.
Sensors detect a ship shooting past, they must have some advanced cloaking
tech!
A video broadcast is sent from the assailant. A character the captain
recognises. The federation spy from earlier.

**DIALOG CONTINUED:** (Voice of the spy) My dear friends, that relic is worth
a lot you know. I'm not a federation spy, nor an Empire officer, but a pirate
that's about to take the relic from your cold, dead hands.

**DIALOG CONTINUED:** The broadcast ends. Battle stations!

## Boarding
An enemy crew of 4 start board the airlock the turn after the broadcast.
Perception here can reveal a boarding craft on approach. The boarding crew
consists of the following:
- 2 heavy's (Armed with plasma rifles)
- 1 robot - heavy (Armed with a heavy launcher)
- 1 standard - The shady man from earlier (Armed with conventional repeater)
All carrying basic loot.
The enemy ship can be destroyed and scrap can be collected. The enemy ship
enters self destruct if boarding is attempted.

## Aftermath
Once the other ship has been defeated, it explodes and leaves a high amount of
loot (10,000sc). The light speed engines have been destroyed and must be
replaced (Cannot be repaired).

A console in the cockpit offers three destinations within cruising distance.
