# Scene three (Deep space)

**DIALOG:** As the engines spin down and the ship falls to cruising speeds the
consoles detect no fleet... or anyone... Suddenly a massive explosion is felt
throughout the ship plunging it into darkness. Alarms from every panel and
console start going haywire and emergency lighting flickers and comes online.
Sensors detect a ship shooting past, they must have some advanced cloaking
tech!
A video broadcast is sent the ship from the assailant. A character the captain
recognises. The federation spy from earlier.

**DIALOG CONTINUED:** (Voice of the spy) My dear friends, that relic is worth
a lot you know. I'm not a federation spy, but a pirate that's about to take the
relic from your cold, dead hands.

**DIALOG CONTINUED:** The broadcast ends. Battle stations!

## Aftermath
Once the other ship has been defeated, it explodes and leaves a high amount of
loot (10,000sc). The light speed engines have been destroyed and must be
replaced (Cannot be repaired).

A console in the cockpit offers three destinations within cruising distance.
