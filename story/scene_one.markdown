# Scene 1 (Initial)

**DIALOG:** You are onboard the `<insert ship name here>` when you are hailed by
an alarm coming from the cockpit. `<insert pilots name here>`, who is already in
the cockpit, reacts to the console. The console causing the racket is the N-FON
computer (Near - Field Object Notifier). Its reporting another vessel is on
approach. An illegal computer system called OEM (Object Evaluation Machine) is
installed within the your ship which detects high value loot onboard the
approaching ship, and is detecting something very valuable.

## Actions:
- Perception:
  - The ship is unmarked.
  - On closer inspection the ship seems not to be damaged although you spot
    that something has impacted the rear of the ship.
  - The ships airlock seems to be operational.
  - The power appears to be out.
- Computers:
  - Execute a ship scan to reveal layout.

## Boarding the vessel
Upon boarding the vessel, the crew notice the oxygen seems to be working along
with the emergency lighting. The airlock has a working computer which can be
used to reveal the layout of the ship (if not already revealed), may disclose
lifeforms aboard on computers check pass (Locks on two fails). Some rooms
contain low rank Cinderferrs.

## Loot
Most rooms will only contain basic loot with exceptions to the cargo hold and
med bay where ammunition and medical supplies can be found. The captain
quarters contains a small, incredibly strong safe containing a small, very
valuable, gold and black coloured, cylindrical object that the OEM system
initially picked up. The captain's quarters contains documents that are
addressed to a high ranking member of the empire, the deceased captain of this
vessel.

## Escape
Two small empire ships wrap in and start to attack the players ship. The pilot
is notified from their rist terminal identifying the threats. The Players ship
faced with such a threat, has to avoid laser-based and missile weaponry while
the crew escapes the other ship. The crew must then speed away to Palmas space
port, their previous location.
