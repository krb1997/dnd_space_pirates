# Scene four (Option destination)

## Ariass
**DIALOG:** The space stations computers check your ship for any bounties and
surprisingly finds nothing. The control room radios in and grants permission
to land at pad 43. The space station is very clean, modern and very busy. It
looks very expensive with a lot of high end shops, goods and ships around the
station. Security is very prevalent but are unaware of the bounty or presence.

### Modifiers
- Prices + 1000sc
- No gangs or faction control
- Security will react to any bad behaviour

## LP9-LHF
**DIALOG:** The moon is very hot but has a breathable atmosphere (No space
suits required). The town looks a little run down but is thriving with numerous
stores and accommodation scattered around. You see no security apart from the
private security outside some stores. You also notice many other ships landed
around the town with their crews armed doing their own business.

### Modifiers
- Prices normal
- Mixed gang presence
- Security only get involved when interfering with the store their protecting.

## Minecorpr-F72
Roll 3 piloting rolls for dodging asteroids upon approach. Each miss is one
damage done to the ship.

**DIALOG:** Clearance is given to land and a security team approaches asking
questions about your visit although they don’t seem to know about any bounty.
After a few questions they leave. There is no atmosphere so space suits must be
worn. The facility itself looks very industrial and has large parts that are
authorized access only. The busy space port has a “civilian” district where all
the stores are located.

## Modifiers
- Prices +500sc
- No gangs but the station is under Rebel control.
- Security seems to light with only a few on patrol. 

**Everything under this line is relevent to all destinations.**

## Event

### Strange object
A random crew members see’s a strange object down a dark back ally with no-one
around. It looks expensive…

Upon taking the item the crew do not know what it is. And will have to get it
appraised. Once sold for 10,000 space credits, another crew run at the player
crew a little later threating them with guns at close range to give back what
they stole. 2x normal class spawn and 1x heavy class.

1 D12 to be rolled every turn while to conflict persists. 8 or less will
attract police if not on LP9-LHF. Enemy crew run and the player crew must deal
with the police 2x heavy.

### Celestial prime location
A crew member sees a TV in a shop or window of a news program detailing a
federation fleet near a planet called Celestial Prime. Co-ordnates are
displayed.

## Attack
The ship repair crew calls the captain to report a “tracking device” found on
the ship’s hull and that they have just removed and destoryed it. Once the crew
arrive back at the ship, an empire fleet jumps into space near the location of
the crew and begins to open fire on the location. The crew manage to slip away
safely but the location is destroyed.
