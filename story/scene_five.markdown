# Scene 5 (Celestial Prime - finale)
**DIALOG:** Dropping out of hyperspace you discover that this time, you
actually arrived at Celestial Prime. The Federation fleet is here too,
completely engaged in a massive space battle with an empire fleet. Giant
capital ships are being blown to bits left, right and center. The chaos is
overwhelming. You detect a scan of your ship from another, followed my a hail
from some federation dude.

The Federation officer asks who they are and how the hell they have the relic.
The crew explains. The federation officer explains that they are losing this
and require the help of the crew to defeat the empire. In doing so the reward
would be great and all there crimes would be expunged from federation
controlled space.
The crew accepts.

been hidden for billions of years with is location unknown and its importance a
myth. Its now been found. The planet itself is covered in countless 20,000 feet
tall structures (made from some sort of metal) which, according to legend, are
