# Scene 2 (Austins space port)

**DIALOG:** Autins space port is a popular small sized space station where
traders, transport and occasionally military ships land to refuel, repair and
rest.
The port looks like a small disk in space with space for about 12 small ships
docked all around the outside edge with the café/bar in the center. The café/bar
is a 2000’s style modern bar with a few food and gambling tables, a juke box and
the main bar itself. Behind said bar is Austin himself, a ex-killbot with a
kill count high enough to wipeout a small coloney, and that was before it
became leader of a tactical team for the Federation doubling it's "high score".
It later retired and built this space port. The space port is busy with people
chilling, having fun with some crews hang around outside around their ships. An
unarmed crew of mechanics also work at the station providing repair services to
ships for a modest price. Also present is a "Junker" store willing to buy pretty
much anything.

**NOTE:** The crew were here yesterday.

## Occupants (Inside bar)

## Events
**The crew should have a few turns to explore and use the various services
available.**

The shady character corners the captain unexpectedly. The character is wearing
empire officer uniform and explains he is in fact, a federation spy. It turns
out the spy was to convince the captain of the unmarked ship, due to land here,
to change his destination to a location with a Federation fleet awaiting to
seize the vessel, and the artifact. The fleet is currently waiting waiting at
Celestial Prime and is willing to give the crew a massive reward for the safe
delivery of the relic. Co-ordinates are given to the captain. The spy then
quickly runs off and it not seen again.

**1-2 turns later...**

The jukebox and PA system is temporary overridden with an emergency broadcast
from an unknown source detailing the attack from pirates on an empire diplomatic
ship and describes the crew. The broadcast then details a bounty which is the
sum of 10,000,000sc (Space credits). The shear size of the bounty makes everyone
in the bar turn to attack.

**The crew, readied, take their actions first.**

A few turns later a fleet of empire warships warp into the sector. They start to
fire missles towards the station. Ships start getting blown up a couple turns
in and the integrity of the station starts to deteriorate.
The crew, back onboard, set the destination to the co-ordinates given and jump
to light speed.
