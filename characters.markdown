# LIAM
`<INSERT NAME>`, A 7 foot tall humanoid being made of rock. Your species has
always confused scientists throughout the galaxy, but everyone knows, you are
a force to be reckoned with. Your not fast, not going to win at any races, but
when you enter a room people immediately note the fastest, most direct exit.

Your role within your crew of space pirates is the badass weapons expert with
skills to rival the best throughout the galaxy. Your brawn is an asset to your
team, carrying out all the heavy lifting. Although you lack the intellect to
complete complex computer based tasks or the most fiddly medical procedures,
you feel its best to leave that nerdy stuff all to the nerds.

Your strong, reliable, dependable and capable. Your strength and skill are the
foundations of your crew. But testing times are ahead, your crew needs you now
more than ever before...

Your the captain `<INSERT NAME>`. You've always been a captain. Stylish,
charismatic, always dressed in the best, your the captain! The success of your
crew has been dictated by your expert planning and leadership. Across galaxy's,
spider infested planets, frozen asteroid belts and thick nebulas, you've always
got your crew through safely.

Beneath that charismatic, flashy outer skin, is possibly the best human pilot
the galaxy's ever seen! You can fly just about anything, and i mean anything.
For `<LIAMS CHARACTER'S NAME>`'s 78th birthday you flew a jet pack controlled
toilet high above the moon on Zanza-3 dropping glitter filled grenades from a
Santa sack singing Queen's "We will rock you". Admittedly you may were a little
drunk but the point remains.

Difficult challenges remain, your time to shine is arriving. Your crew will be
looking up to you for the leadership they have always come to suspect.

I wish i could tell you what `<INSERT NAME>` looks like. But he's too
difficult to see! Your stealth tech and skill is unparalleled. Equipped with
the best melee gear in the business to enable silent take downs of anyone you
decide is a target. Its not just organics that should be afraid, every computer
system within a 100m radius is prone to your hacking skills.

This 5ft short-arse human is definitely not someone you want to call a
short-arse. Your stealth tech doesn't end with your dual, i can cut through
anything swords, oh no. That cape made of nano tech cloth which can be consumed
by your collar is out of this world... Literally! And those stealth goggles
which provide full night vision but are only the size and look like normal
glasses, awesome!

For someone who relishes the dark and the opportunities it provides, your
skills are now needed more than ever.
